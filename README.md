## Notes

One of the most interesting parts of the project was the concepts of fragments and their usage with BottomNavBars. I was
anticipating on how I can use fragments with Activities because this was a something I had in mind. Overall, I did face a few
issues with the difference between Fragments but as we practiced more on creating them I understood the important parts such as 
the OnViewCreated() method.

## Notes

A few challenges in this project so far was creating and using the Camera Explicit intent since I was getting a few issues
which required the query for APIs 30+ and establishing our application as a content provider to take images for our application.
Also, a few issues were encountered while setting up the Parse Back4App credentials since my credentials and the android app
required to be changed and/or reset.
